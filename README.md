# Financial Analysis of the Indian Banking Sector

This project presents a comprehensive financial analysis of major Indian banking stocks using Python and data-driven techniques.

The analysis focuses on evaluating risk–return performance, valuation metrics, and sector-level behavior, while using machine learning methods to explore behavioral patterns and test short-term return predictability.

## Key Areas of Analysis
- Return and volatility analysis
- Risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio)
- Valuation comparison using P/B, P/E, and ROE
- Behavioral regime identification using clustering
- Assessment of short-term return predictability
- Model evaluation and feature importance analysis

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Yahoo Finance (yfinance)

## Key Takeaways
- Banking stocks exhibit meaningful differences in risk-adjusted performance and valuation.
- Machine learning helps identify behavioral patterns but offers limited short-term predictability.
- Results reinforce the importance of financial fundamentals and market efficiency in banking sector analysis.
